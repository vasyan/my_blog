I spent two months searching for the right sprocket for my Keeway Superlight 200. Honestly, I might have been doing something wrong, but there were no clear results on Google for "sprocket for Keeway Superlight 200." Even worse, JTR—the most popular sprocket manufacturer in my region—didn't list this bike as compatible with the sprocket that actually fits!

I ordered two incorrect sprockets and had to return them, even though they were advertised as "Keeway Superlight 200 compatible." A huge waste of time. So, I hope this post gets indexed properly and helps anyone struggling to find the correct Keeway Superlight 200 rear sprocket dimensions or model. The correct one is [JTR269](https://www.jtsprockets.com/catalogue/part/JTR269/).

One seller insisted that the sprocket's hub diameter was 60mm, but that was completely wrong for my bike. I measured it myself, and it's definitely 58mm, exactly as JTR269 specifies.

Another mistake I made was ordering the correct size but the wrong shape. The Keeway Superlight 200 uses an old sprocket fitting design, so it's crucial to get the correct shape on the side facing the wheel. This is what allows the bolts to fit properly. Be careful—don't make the same mistakes I did!

In the end, I ordered the correct sprocket on Amazon and am now waiting for delivery. Let’s see how it goes!
