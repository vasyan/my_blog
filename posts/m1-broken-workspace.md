There are many evidences that for some reason you just cannot switch to an application that is open on another workspace. BTW, workspaces are awesome when it works, I had a great time with my another laptop and being a happy user of [Amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst) as window tile manager and [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) mainly as app switcher by hotkeys (I really love how my Linux setup with DWM works). However, my lovely m1 macbook has more problems that [I talked before](/blog/m1-external-monitor-flickering).

One day it became impossible to switch between apps in a way I used to work either alt+tab either hotkey (for hotkey I recommend to use Karabiner and [pimp up your capslock](https://github.com/Vonng/Capslock)). Recommendations on support forums and reddit-like resources merely pathetic hopeless click-clack in System Preferences, toggle "" in Mission Control settings like "When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows of application" or "Display have separated Spaces" or do it in terminal then reboot then check again, then toggle, then reboot. You got it. Dang it!

Solution? Go for a hardcore, choose tile window management, nothing but Aerospace.

It is BEAUTIFUL, works great, I removed that crap (Amethyst and Hammerspoon (and AltTab - it doesn't solve the problem)) right away.

Just dedicate some time, read the guide and enjoy keyboard-friendly macbook experience.

I'm done. Good luck.

as far we talk about keyboard-centric-lifestyle, here we go.
